W3U3 Redone Basic
=================

In the http://open.sap.com MOOC there's a course
"[Introduction to Mobile Solution Development](https://open.sap.com/course/mobile1)"
which takes the participant through a series of weeks and units where they learn about mobile development in
the SAP and enterprise context. Some of the examples use the SAPUI5 framework, but in a rather unorthodox way
and this repo is an attempt to re-write the app in Week 3 Unit 3 (W3U3) in a more conventional way, taking
advantages of various SAPUI5 framework features rather than ignoring or abusing them.

I've deliberately tried to keep as much to the spirit of the original app as possible, not trying to improve it
functionally or add any features, and sticking to the MVC view progression as much as possible. This means that 
there are things that I'm not including in this re-write, such as the Application.js-based or Component.js-based
best practices.
