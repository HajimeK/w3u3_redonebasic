W3U3 Redone Basic
=================

In the http://open.sap.com MOOC there's a course
"[Introduction to Mobile Solution Development](https://open.sap.com/course/mobile1)"
which takes the participant through a series of weeks and units where they learn about mobile development in
the SAP and enterprise context. Some of the examples use the SAPUI5 framework, but in a rather unorthodox way
and this repo is an attempt to re-write the app in Week 3 Unit 3 (W3U3) in a more conventional way, taking
advantages of various SAPUI5 framework features rather than ignoring or abusing them.
